Welcome to an incomplete codex of Keymaster's Keep games.

It aims to give a quick impression of what games exist, and what kind of tasks they'll give you without the need to dig through a lot of source code.

Objectives with a ⚠️ are "Difficult", ⌛ are "Time Consuming".

All objective lists are generated with default yaml options, There is no attempt to figure out what happens if you change them.
